Rise and Recovery of myopia Among School-Aged Students from 2019 to 2024: A Population-based Longitudinal Study in Wenzhou, China

**Question:** What are the temporal patterns of myopia progression among school-aged students from 2019 to 2024?

**Findings:** Overall myopia prevalence demonstrated a rise-and-fall pattern, increasing from 50.73% (2019) to 55.68% (2022), then decreasing to 54.77% (2024). First-grade students exhibited more dramatic changes with a 1.28-fold increase in 2020 (versus 1.04-fold across all grades). Post-pandemic analysis revealed two distinct phases: higher incidence during 2020-2022 (IRR, 1.35) followed by moderation during 2022-2024 (IRR, 1.08).

**Meaning:** The identified temporal patterns suggest that school-based myopia progression is potentially modifiable, with particular importance of intervention timing.
